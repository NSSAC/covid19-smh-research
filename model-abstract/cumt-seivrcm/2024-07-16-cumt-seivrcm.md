## Were there any changes in the process of calibration to Phase II A’ compared to Phase I A? 
No

## Were there any other significant drivers that influenced your projections in Scenarios B-D (compared to Scenario A), beyond modified transmissibility and severity? 
No

## What was the method used to reduce non-household transmission?
To reduce non-household transmission in our SEIVRCM model in the projection periods, we adjusted the beta values (transmission rates) for racial groups other than the White group. Specifically, we set these values to match the White group’s beta values when the original values for these other groups were higher.

## Which groups, if any, had lower transmission than the White population in either location?
In our model, the transmission rates change monthly to fitting the number of deaths in the projection periods. In California, transmission rates for the Asian, Black, Latino, and Other groups were lower than those for the White group in the last month. Additionally, the Asian and Other groups had lower transmission rates than the White group in some other months. In North Carolina, the Asian, Black, and Other groups had lower transmission rates than the White group in some months.

## What was the method used to reduce age-adjusted severity?
To reduce age-adjusted severity in our SEIVRCM model, we adjusted the infection fatality rates (IFR) for racial groups other than the White group. Specifically, we calculated IFR values of different racial groups for two age groups: over 65 and others. For each age group, we aligned the IFR values of these racial groups with those of the White group when their original values were higher. We then constructed age-adjusted IFR values for each racial group based on the population ratios between the two age groups.

## Which groups, if any, had lower severity rates than the White population in either location? 
In our SEIVRCM model, which uses smoothed daily IFR values based on daily death numbers and serology data, the findings were as follows: In California, the Other group had lower IFR values than the White group, while the Asian, Black, and Latino groups did not. In North Carolina, the Asian and Other groups had lower IFR values than the White group.

## What was the average age-adjusted reduction in severity in Scenario C for each racial/ethnic population, relative to the White population?
