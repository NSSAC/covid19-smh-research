## Were there any changes in the process of calibration to Phase II Aâ€™ compared to Phase I A? 
We extended the calibration window to cover the entire period. Additionally, we fitted infection risk parameters for each race/ethnic group using serology data to account for differences in non-household transmission risk.

## Were there any other significant drivers that influenced your projections in Scenarios B-D (compared to Scenario A), beyond modified transmissibility and severity? 
No.

## What was the method used to reduce non-household transmission?
In modeling the force of infection, we differentiate between the contributions of household and non-household contacts. For non-household contacts, infection risks are modulated by a race/ethnicity-specific factor estimated from serology data. For reference, this factor is set to 1 for the White population. In scenarios B and D, if the factor for a particular race/ethnicity is higher than 1 (indicating higher infection risks relative to the White population), we adjust it to 1 in the simulations.

## Which groups, if any, had lower transmission than the White population in either location?
Only the Asian group had, on average, lower transmission than the White population in both California and North Carolina. 

## What was the method used to reduce age-adjusted severity?
We calculate an age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFR) for each race/ethnicity based on their age distribution. We then determine the ratio of each group's IFR to that of the White population. Next, we compare this ratio to the ratio obtained from the simulation. If the simulated ratio exceeds the expected ratio, it indicates that the group has a higher age-adjusted severity compared to the White population. In scenarios C and D, if the group's IFR ratio is higher than expected, we adjust the IFR to align the resulting ratio with the expected one.

## Which groups, if any, had lower severity rates than the White population in either location? 
In California, only the Other group had lower severity rates than the White population. In North Carolina, both the Other and the Asian groups had lower severity rates than the White population.

## What was the average age-adjusted reduction in severity in Scenario C for each racial/ethnic population, relative to the White population?
