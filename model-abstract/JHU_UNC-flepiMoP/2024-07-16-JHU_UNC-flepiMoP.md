## Were there any changes in the process of calibration to Phase II Aâ€™ compared to Phase I A? 
We extended the calibration time frame for the entire projection period (i.e. from January 2020 to April 2021). 

## Were there any other significant drivers that influenced your projections in Scenarios B-D (compared to Scenario A), beyond modified transmissibility and severity? 
No

## What was the method used to reduce non-household transmission?
We modified transmission parameters for all other race-ethnicities to match the white population. 

## Which groups, if any, had lower transmission than the White population in either location?
None

## What was the method used to reduce age-adjusted severity?
We use age-adjusted severity parameters estimated from prior serology studies. We then index these values as the IFR's for the white population. For other race-ethnicities, a modifier is multiplied to these values (applied equally to all age groups) to determine r/e-specific relative severities. If these multipliers are (on average) less than 1, this corresponds to lower severity than the white population, and if they are greater than 1, this corresponds to higher severity. For populations with values higher than 1 we apply the corresponding value for the white population in the projection period. 

## Which groups, if any, had lower severity rates than the White population in either location? 
In California, the Other population had significantly lower severity rates than the White population, and the Black and Asian populations had marginally lower severity. In North Carolina, the Asian population had lower severity rates than the White population.

## What was the average age-adjusted reduction in severity in Scenario C for each racial/ethnic population, relative to the White population? 
### Average percent reduction in severity relative to White (%)
