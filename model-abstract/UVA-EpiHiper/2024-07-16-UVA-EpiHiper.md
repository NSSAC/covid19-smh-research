## Were there any changes in the process of calibration to Phase II Aâ€™ compared to Phase I A?
We used the extra data in the projection period (November 15, 2020 to April 3, 2021) to extend the calibration window.

## Were there any other significant drivers that influenced your projections in Scenarios B-D (compared to Scenario A), beyond modified transmissibility and severity?
No.

## What was the method used to reduce non-household transmission?
We changed the race/ethnicity specific transmissibility values of the none-white groups to be the same as that of the white group.

## Which groups, if any, had lower transmission than the White population in either location?
None.

## What was the method used to reduce age-adjusted severity?
To reduce age-adjusted severity, we adjusted the age-specific infection fatality rates (IFR) for race/ethnicity groups other than the white. We first estimated IFR value of each race/ethnicity group in each of two age groups (<65 and 65+) from scenario A results. In this step we used the relative severity result that the ratio of IFR(<65) and IFR(65+) is 0.046. Next, for each age group, if any non-white group has a larger IFR value than the white group, we set it to be the same as the IFR of the white. We then used the adjusted age-specific IFR values to obtain death projections in scenarios C and D.

## Which groups, if any, had lower severity rates than the White population in either location? 
In North Carolina, all non-white groups had lower IFR values than the white group. In California, the black and other groups had lower IFR values than the white group.

## What was the average age-adjusted reduction in severity in Scenario C for each racial/ethnic population, relative to the White population?
