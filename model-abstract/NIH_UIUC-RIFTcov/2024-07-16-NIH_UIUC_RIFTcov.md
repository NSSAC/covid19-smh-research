## Were there any changes in the process of calibration to Phase II Aâ€™ compared to Phase I A? 
Calibration was done in two waves, with the cutoff for the first wave at October 15. In the first wave, beginning NPI compliance was calibrated for each race/ethnicity, as well as reporting rate and the rate leaving NPIs. In contrast to the previous phase, the IFR was not calibrated; instead this was estimated by race/ethnicity from serology and the target deaths data over the whole study period. In the second wave, because new NPI orders are implemented during calibration, we added a type III functional response curve for NPI uptake with a fixed concavity (k=2) that allows gradual NPI uptake. This takes two parameters: (1) the maximum NPI compliance, and (2) the week at which half of this maximum is compliant. We explicitly calibrated on the change in maximum compliance from wave 1, and fixed the halfway week at 10 for calibration. We also calibrated the change in reporting rate compared to wave 1, and rate leaving NPIs. 

## Were there any other significant drivers that influenced your projections in Scenarios B-D (compared to Scenario A), beyond modified transmissibility and severity? 
To capture differences in transmission, we stratified NPI compliance and contact across groups. Therefore, our modified transmissibility scenarios reflect mitigation in contact and NPI compliance rather than explicit changes in a single transmissibility parameter. 

## What was the method used to reduce non-household transmission?
The absolute reduction in work contacts was indexed off of the White population, and NPI compliance was matched to the White population. 

## Which groups, if any, had lower transmission than the White population in either location?
In North Carolina, reductions in work contacts were greater in non-White populations than White in almost all cases, except for the Other group when considering Asian contacts. In California, the following ego/alter pairings saw greater reductions in workplace contact than the White population: Asian/Asian, Asian/Black, Asian/Other, Black/Black, Black/Latino, Black/Other, Latino/Latino, Latino/Other, Other/Other. When looking at NPI compliance, in NC all groups had lower compliance than White except Asian, which had equal compliance. In CA, all groups had lower compliance except Other, which had equal compliance. 

## What was the method used to reduce age-adjusted severity?
Case and death data by age from CA and NC were used to determine a relative severity ratio between under 65/over 65, assuming that the reporting rate varies only by race/ethnicity and not by age. We estimated that under 65 had ~0.046 of the IFR value for over 65. Then, using the proportion under/over 65 for each race/ethnicity, we calculated the contribution of each group towards the overall IFR. From here, any groups with higher age-adjusted IFR than the White population were indexed to the White IFR, and the population-level IFR was recalculated for that group. 

## Which groups, if any, had lower severity rates than the White population in either location? 
In NC, Asian and Other groups had lower severity than the White population. In CA, only the Other group had a lower severity rate than the White population. 

## What was the average age-adjusted reduction in severity in Scenario C for each racial/ethnic population, relative to the White population?
### Average percent reduction in severity relative to White (%)
