methods: "An agent-based model simulates stochastic disease transmissions in a synthetic contact network, using a two-variant disease model stratified by both age and race/ethnicity."
methods_long: "We upgraded our USA digital twin to integrate race/ethnicity in demographics, mobility, and contact network. Heterogeneous contacts within and between race/ethnicity groups are modeled at individual level. We calibrated race/ethnicity specific transmissibility and IFR parameters using serology, cases, and deaths data."
